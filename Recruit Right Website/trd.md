# Technical Requirements Document (TRD)

## Project Overview

- **Project Name:** Recruit Right: Precision Hiring with AI Insights
- **Project Description:**
  Recruit Right is an AI-powered recruitment platform designed to streamline the hiring process by automating resume screening, scheduling interviews, and providing AI-driven insights for candidate evaluation. The system aims to enhance efficiency for organizations, simplify the process for candidates, and enable interviewers to conduct structured assessments.
- **Stakeholders:**
  - Hiring Organizations
  - Job Candidates
  - Interviewers (Technical Engineers)
  - System Administrators

## Objectives

- **Primary Objective:**
  To create an AI-powered recruitment platform that reduces the time and effort required to screen candidates, schedule interviews, and assess their suitability for job roles.

- **Secondary Objectives:**
  - Automate resume screening using Named Entity Recognition (NER).
  - Enable efficient interview scheduling for candidates and interviewers.
  - Generate AI-assisted candidate evaluation reports.
  - Provide seamless integration with external video conferencing tools (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet).

## Functional Requirements

- **Requirement 1:** Automated Resume Screening
  - The system will extract key details from resumes using NER and match them against job descriptions.
- **Requirement 2:** Candidate & Interviewer Portal
  - Candidates can create profiles, upload resumes, and choose interview slots.
  - Interviewers can register, specify their expertise, and pick candidates for interviews.
- **Requirement 3:** Interview Scheduling and Integration
  - The system will automatically schedule interviews based on availability and generate meeting links.
- **Requirement 4:** AI-Assisted Candidate Evaluation
  - Interviewers will fill structured Google Forms, and AI will generate candidate evaluation reports.
- **Requirement 5:** Organization Dashboard
  - Organizations can track job postings, view shortlisted candidates, and access interview feedback.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**
  - System response time for job posting, resume analysis, and scheduling should be under 2 seconds.
  - Must handle at least 100 concurrent users without degradation.
- **Scalability:**
  - The platform should be designed to scale across multiple organizations and users.
  - Cloud-based hosting with serverless architecture for handling peak loads.
- **Security:**
  - User authentication with role-based access control (RBAC).
  - Data encryption for resumes and personal details.
  - Secure API communication.
- **Usability:**
  - Intuitive UI for organizations, candidates, and interviewers.
  - Mobile-friendly design.

## System Architecture

- **Overview:**
  - The system follows a microservices-based architecture with frontend, backend, and AI components.
- **Components:**
  - Frontend: React.js (for user dashboards)
  - Backend: Node.js with Express (API services)
  - Database: Firebase Firestore (for data storage)
  - AI Component: Python (for NER-based resume screening)
  - Third-Party Integration: Google Meet/Zoom API (for interviews)
- **Data Flow:**
  1. Organization posts a job.
  2. Candidates upload resumes.
  3. AI extracts relevant details and filters resumes.
  4. Selected candidates schedule interviews.
  5. Interviewers conduct interviews and submit reports.
  6. Organizations review AI-generated insights and make hiring decisions.

## Technical Constraints

- **Technology Stack:**
  - Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS
  - Backend: Node.js, Express.js
  - Database: Firebase Firestore
  - AI Processing: Python (SpaCy for NER)
  - Authentication: Firebase Authentication
  - Deployment: Firebase Hosting & Functions
- **Limitations:**
  - Initial AI resume screening accuracy may require iterative improvements.
  - Integration with third-party video conferencing tools depends on API limitations.

## Testing and Validation

- **Testing Strategy:**
  - Unit Testing (Jest for React, Mocha for Node.js)
  - Integration Testing (Postman for API tests)
  - User Acceptance Testing (UAT with real recruiters and candidates)
  - Security Testing (Penetration testing for authentication and data security)
- **Validation Criteria:**
  - AI-based resume screening accuracy should be above 80%.
  - System should handle 1000 resumes per day without performance issues.
  - Interview scheduling should ensure no conflicts in availability.

## Deployment

- **Environment:**
  - Development: Local environment with Firebase Emulator Suite
  - Staging: Test environment on Firebase for internal testing
  - Production: Deployed on Firebase Hosting with Firestore as the primary database
- **Deployment Process:**
  1. Code committed to GitHub.
  2. Automated CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) runs tests and builds the application.
  3. Deployment to Firebase via CI/CD pipeline.

## Maintenance and Support

- **Maintenance Plan:**
  - Regular updates for AI model improvements.
  - Bug tracking and resolution via GitHub Issues.
  - Security audits every 3 months.
- **Support:**
  - Email-based support for organizations and candidates.
  - Documentation and FAQs for self-service troubleshooting.
